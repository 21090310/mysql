# Create database and account {#concept_jx1_w5g_wdb .concept}

Before RDS can be used, a database and an account must be created for the RDS instance. For PPAS instance, you must create an initial account on the RDS console. And then you can create and manage the databases through a client. This document takes the client pgAdmin 4 as an example to introduce how to create databases and accounts for PPAS instance.

## Precautions {#section_zfc_bvg_wdb .section}

-   Databases under a single instance share all the resources of this instance. Each PPAS instance supports one initial account, countless general accounts, and countless databases. You must create and manage the general accounts and databases through SQL statements.

-   To migrate the local database to RDS, you must create the same database and account in RDS instance as those of the local database.

-   When assigning account permissions for each database, follow the minimum permission principle and service roles to create accounts and rationally assign Read-only and Read/Write permissions. When necessary, you can split accounts and databases into smaller units so that each account can only access data for its own services. If the account does not need to write data to a database, assign Read-only permission.

-   For database security, set strong passwords for the accounts and change the passwords regularly.

    Parameter description:

    -   Host name/address: refers to the connection address of the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance by using the intranet, enter the intranet address of the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance by using the Internet, enter the Internet address of the RDS instance. The following procedure shows how to find the connection address and port number of the RDS instance.

        1.  Log on to the [RDS console](https://rds.console.aliyun.com/).
        2.  Select the region where the target instance is located.
        3.  Click the ID of the instance to visit the Basic Information page.
        4.  Find the Internet/intranet address and Internet/intranet port number of the instance, as shown in the following figure.

            ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/7862/4050_en-US.png)

    -   Port: refers to the port number of the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance by using the intranet, enter the intranet port number of the RDS instance.

    -   Username: refers to the initial account name of the RDS instance.

    -   Password: refers to the password corresponding to the initial account of the RDS instance.

13. Click **Save**.
14. If the connection information is correct, select **Servers** \> **server name** \> **Databases** \> **edb or postgres**, and the following interface appears, which indicates that the connection to RDS instance is successful.

    **Note:** edb and postgres are the default system databases of the RDS instance. Do not do any operation in these two databases.
