# Create account and database for MySQL 5.7 Basic Edition {#concept_qn2_r2g_vdb .concept}

**Note:** This document is applicable only to MySQL 5.7 Basic Edition instance. For more information on how to create database and account for MySQL 5.7 High-availability Edition and MySQL 5.6 instance, see [Create account and database for MySQL 5.7 High-availability Edition/5.5/5.6 instances](intl.en-US/Quick Start for MySQL/Initial configuration/Create database and account/Create account and database for MySQL 5.7 High-availability Edition/5.5/5.6 instances.md#).

Before RDS can be used, a database and an account must be created for the RDS instance. For MySQL 5.7 Basic Edition instance, you must create an initial account on the RDS console. Then you can create and manage the databases through a client. This document takes the client MySQL-Front as an example to introduce how to create databases and accounts for MySQL 5.7 Basic Edition instance.

## Background information {#section_gzr_zzm_vdb .section}

-   Databases under a single instance share all the resources of this instance. Each instance supports one initial account, countless general accounts, and countless databases. You must create and manage the general accounts and databases through SQL statements. For more information, see [Commonly used SQL commands \(MySQL\)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/43889.htm).

-   To migrate the local database to RDS, you must create the same database and account in RDS instance as those of the local database.

-   When assigning account permissions for each database, follow the minimum permissionâ€™ principle and service roles to create accounts and rationally assign Read-only and Read/Write permissions. When necessary, you can split accounts and databases into smaller units so that each account can only access data for its own services. If the account does not need to write data to a database, assign Read-only permission.

-   For database security, set strong passwords for the accounts and change the passwords regularly.
