# Create account and database for MySQL 5.7 High-availability Edition/5.5/5.6 instances {#concept_ck1_1kf_vdb .concept}

This document is applicable only to MySQL 5.7 High-availability Edition, MySQL 5.5, and MySQL 5.6 instances. For more information on how to create a database and an account for MySQL 5.7, see [EN-US\_TP\_7820.md\#](intl.en-US/Quick Start for MySQL/Initial configuration/Create database and account/Create account and database for MySQL 5.7 Basic Edition.md#).

Before using RDS, you must create databases and accounts in the RDS instance. For MySQL 5.7 High-availability Edition, MySQL 5.5, and MySQL 5.6 instances, this document provides detailed procedure to create and manage the databases and accounts directly by using the RDS console.

## Attention {#section_zcc_gkf_vdb .section}

-   Databases under a single instance share all the resources of this instance. Each instance supports up to 500 databases and 500 accounts.

-   To migrate the local database to RDS, you must create the same database and account as those of the local database.

-   When assigning account permissions for each database, follow the minimum permissionsâ€™ principle and service roles to create accounts and rationally assign Read-only and Read/Write permissions. When necessary, you can split accounts and databases into smaller units so that each account can only access data for its own services. If the account does not need to write data to a database, assign Read-only permission.

-   For database security, set strong passwords for the accounts and change the passwords regularly.
