-   You can renew the instance within the contract period or within 15 days after contract expiration.
-   The renewed instance is billed based on the new configuration and length of service time you select during renewal. For more information about billing standards, see [Pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/apsaradb-for-rds?spm=a3c0i.7938564.220486.9.42173afcq1FHk9#pricing).
