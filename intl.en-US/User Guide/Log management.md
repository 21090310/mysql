# Log management {#concept_ujc_hz4_ydb .concept}

All instances except MySQL 5.7 support log management. You can use the console or SQL commands to query error logs and slow SQL log details for fault analysis. However, you can manage logs of SQL Server 2012 instances and later versions only through SQL commands. This article describes how to manage logs through the console and SQL commands.

## Use the console to manage logs {#section_qf4_jz4_ydb .section}

You can use the console to manage logs of MySQL 5.5/5.6, SQL Server 2008 R2, PostgreSQL, and PPAS instances. The actual interface may vary depending on the engine type and version.

## Procedure {#section_vqv_kz4_ydb .section}

1.  Log on to the [RDS console](https://rds.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Select the region where the target instance is located.
3.  Click the ID of the target instance to enter the Basic Information page.
4.  Select **Log Management** in the left-side navigation pane.
5.  On the Log Management page, select **Error Log**, **Slow SQL Log Details**, **Slow SQL Log Summary**, or Switch Logs, select a time range, and click **Query**.

    |Query item|Content|
    |----------|-------|
    |Error Log|Records the SQL statement that failed to be executed in the past month.|
    |Slow SQL Log Details|     -   Records the SQL statements that lasted for over 1 second \(You can modify this time threshold by modifying the long\_query\_time parameter in **Parameters**\) in the past month. Similar SQL statements are displayed once only.
    -   The list does not include slow SQL logs of the past two hours. To query these logs, check the slow\_log\_view table in the MySQL database.

    |Slow SQL Log Summary|Provides statistics and analysis reports for SQL statements that lasted for over 1 second \(You can modify this time threshold by modifying the long\_query\_time parameter in Parameters\) in the past month.Â |


## Use SQL commands to manage logs {#section_amm_rz4_ydb .section}

To query error logs of SQL Server 2012 and later versions, use this procedure:

```
sp_rds_read_error_logs
```

The usage method is the same as using this stored procedure:

```
sp_readerrorlog
```

Examples are as follows:

Example 1:

```
EXEC sp_rds_read_error_logs
```

Example 2:

```
EXEC sp_rds_read_error_logs 0,1 ,'error'
```
