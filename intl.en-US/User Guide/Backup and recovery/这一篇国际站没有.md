# Create a clone instance {#concept_vrh_qp4_ydb .concept}

You can restore data of an instance to a new instance to create a clone instance. The restored data includes instance data and settings. Clone instances are managed and billed in the same way as the master instances. For more information, see [Pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/apsaradb-for-rds?spm=a3c0i.7960336.224002.20.6cf85179HAnBQE#pricing).

**Note:** Currently, the following RDS instances support clone instances:

-   MySQL 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 master instances \(except MySQL 5.7 Basic Edition\)

-   SQL Server 2016 High-Availability Edition \(including Standard and Enterprise Editions\)

-   SQL Server 2012 High-Availability Edition \(including Standard and Enterprise Editions\)


## Background information {#section_f1x_w44_ydb .section}

You can specify a backup set or any time point within the backup period to create a clone instance. Clone instances only copy the content of the master instance. They do not copy the content of read-only and disaster tolerance instances under the master instance. The copied content includes the information of databases, accounts, and instance settings \(such as whitelist, backup settings, parameters, and alarm thresholds\).

The database engine of the clone instance must be the same as that of the master instance. Other settings can be different, such as the billing method, instance series, zone, network type, instance specifications, and storage capacitity. If the clone instance is used to recover data of the master instance, we recommend that the clone instance has higher specifications and and storage capacity than the master instance. Otherwise, the recovery may take a long time.

The accounts of the clone instance are the same as those of the master instance, but you can modify the account passwords. For example, if you create a clone instance for a master instance that uses a master account, the clone instance also uses the master account.

## Prerequisites {#section_o5q_1p4_ydb .section}

The master instance must meet the following conditions:

-   Running and unlocked

-   No migration task is ongoing.

-   Data backup and log backup are enabled.

-   If the clone instance is to be created from a backup set, the master instance must have at least one backup set.

    **Note:** To use a sub-account to create a clone instance, ensure that the sub-account has added authorization policies for clone instances, and add authorization see Cloud Database The RDS is licensed.
