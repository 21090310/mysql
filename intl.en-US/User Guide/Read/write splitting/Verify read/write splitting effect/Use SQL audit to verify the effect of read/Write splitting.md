# Use SQL audit to verify the read/write splitting effect {#concept_bsg_5bv_ydb .concept}

You can use SQL audit logs to verify the effect of read/write splitting by comparing the number of SQL statements executed by the master instance and that of the read-only instances that participate in read/write splitting.

To enable SQL audit and view SQL audit logs, see [EN-US\_TP\_7947.md\#](intl.en-US/User Guide/Security management/只有中国站.md#).
